# Telemetry Web Example

A browser page wired to [`@gears-frontx/telemetry`](../../), posting to a local collector.

It consumes the package exactly as an external user would — a `dependencies` entry on the published
entry point, no reaching into `src/`, no path aliases. If the example compiles, the public API and
the emitted types are usable.

## Run

From anywhere in the monorepo:

```sh
npm run demo:telemetry
```

Or from this directory:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5273>. The port is pinned in `vite.config.ts` because the `url` in
`src/main.ts` is absolute, and it is 5273 rather than vite's default so this example and the
monorepo's own dev server can run at the same time.

`predev` builds the SDK first, so a fresh clone works in one command. The example consumes the SDK's
`dist/`, not its source, so re-run after changing the SDK.

`optimizeDeps.exclude` lists the SDK. Vite otherwise pre-bundles it into `node_modules/.vite` and
keeps serving that copy after a rebuild — the example would silently run stale SDK code, which is
worse than useless for a page whose job is to validate the SDK.

## Where the events go

`url` is set to `http://localhost:5273/api/events`. A ~20-line Vite middleware in `vite.config.ts`
accepts the POST, pretty-prints the body to the terminal and replies `204`.

That middleware stands in for the ingestion backend. The package is transport-agnostic: it sends
whatever envelope the SDK builds to whatever `url` you configure. Swap the `url` to point at a real
collector and nothing else changes.

Records also render on the page, via an example plugin on the `event` hook — that fires *before* the
record is queued, so the page shows the same object the collector receives.

## What the page demonstrates

| Section | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| Autocapture | Ordinary buttons, links, inputs and a form. Nothing calls the SDK; autocapture listens on `document` for `click`, `change` and `submit`. |
| Redaction | A password field and a card number. Neither value reaches a record — the field names and value shapes trip the redaction rules. |
| Opting out | A subtree carrying `data-telemetry-no-capture="false"`. Note the value is inverted; see the SDK README's *Known gaps*. |
| Element hook | A button registering a hook under `telemetryElementHookKey`, contributing service attribution and custom `data`. |
| Explicit API | `logEvent`, `identify` and `destroy`. |

This page drives the core SDK directly, the way a non-HAI3 consumer would. For wiring the gear into
a HAI3 app instead, see the `./plugin` entry documented in the [package README](../../README.md).

## Notes

- `sessionDuration` is set to 60s rather than the 30 minute default, so a session boundary is
  observable without waiting.
- `verbose: true`, so the SDK also logs to the browser console.
- The plugin in `src/main.ts` is written inline. `context` and `record` are typed contextually —
  writing a plugin requires no type imports.
